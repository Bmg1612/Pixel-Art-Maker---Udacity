# Pixel-Art-Maker---Udacity
Project of 'Intro to Javascript' in the Nanodegree Course 'Intro to Programming'.

## Details
This repo has 3 files: `index.html`, `design.js` and `styles.css`.

The HTML file displays de WEB page that initially shows de grid. This web page is stylized with the CSS file.

To build the grid and to color it, the JS file is used with the DOM.

## JavaScript

The explanation of the JS code is make whitin the code, as in:
```
//Wait for the DOM content to be fully loaded
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
    //Then runs the function
    size.addEventListener('submit', function (e) {
```
